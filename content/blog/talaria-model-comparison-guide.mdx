**Our recommendation**: Comprehensive theft coverage is essential for any Talaria.

### Modification Coverage
Common upgrades that should be covered:

| Modification | Typical Cost | Common On |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| 72V Battery Upgrade | $800-1,500 | All models |
| Controller Upgrade | $300-600 | Sting, Sting R |
| Suspension Upgrade | $500-1,200 | Sting, MX4 |
| Brake Upgrade | $200-500 | All models |
| Display/Controller | $150-400 | All models |

### Liability Needs
Higher performance = higher liability risk. We recommend:
- **Sting/XXX**: Minimum $100k liability
- **Sting R/MX4**: Consider $300k+ liability
