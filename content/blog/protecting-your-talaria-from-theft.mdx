# Protecting Your Talaria from Theft

Talaria electric bikes are unfortunately high-value theft targets. Their combination of desirability, portability, and resale value makes them attractive to thieves. Here's how to protect your investment.

## Why Talarias Are Theft Targets

Understanding the risk helps you protect against it:

- **High resale value**: A used Sting still commands $3,000+
- **Parts value**: Batteries alone can sell for $800-1,500
- **No registration**: Unlike motorcycles, harder to trace
- **Portable**: Can be lifted into a truck quickly
- **Growing demand**: More buyers = more thieves looking

## Physical Security Measures

### At Home

**The Basics:**
- Store in a locked garage or shed
- Use a ground anchor bolted to concrete
- Chain through the frame (not just wheels)
- Install motion-sensor lighting

**Advanced Protection:**
- GPS tracker (hidden in frame or battery compartment)
- Smart lock with app alerts
- Security camera coverage
- Alarm system integration

### In Public

**Essential Practices:**
- Never leave unattended for long periods
- Use two different lock types (chain + U-lock)
- Lock to immovable objects
- Remove the battery when possible
- Park in high-visibility areas

**Best Locks for Talarias:**
- Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit (chain)
- Abus Granit X-Plus (U-lock)
- Pragmasis Protector chain

## GPS Tracking Options

Modern GPS trackers offer real-time location tracking:

2. **Tile Pro** - Good range, crowd-sourced finding
3. **Invoxia GPS Tracker** - No subscription, long battery
4. **Monimoto** - Designed for vehicles, motion alerts

### Installation Tips
