# Why Your Talaria Needs Specialized Insurance Coverage

If you own a Talaria electric bike, you already know it's not your average bicycle. With peak power outputs reaching 10kW and top speeds exceeding 60mph, these machines are serious pieces of engineering that deserve serious protection.

## The Problem with Standard Insurance

Most traditional insurance policies weren't designed with high-performance e-bikes in mind. Here's what typically happens:

### Homeowner's Insurance Limitations

Your homeowner's or renter's insurance might cover your Talaria, but with significant limitations:

- **Low coverage limits**: Most policies cap personal property at $1,500-$2,500 for "vehicles"
- **Replacement value issues**: They may only cover depreciated value, not what you paid
- **No liability coverage**: If you cause an accident, you're on your own
- **Modification exclusions**: Aftermarket upgrades usually aren't covered

### Traditional Motorcycle Insurance Gaps

While some motorcycle policies might accept Talarias, they often:

- Charge excessive premiums designed for gas-powered bikes
- Don't understand e-bike-specific components (batteries, controllers)
- May require registration/licensing your e-bike
- Have restrictive usage clauses
